# Status of the Compiler (Updated 08/08/2024)

There are multiple phases of the compiler project which are necessary according to the schematics laid out in
Spring 2024 regarding the architecture.

Downstairs is an image detailing the phases of a Compiler.

## Lexical Analyzer and Syntax Analyzer

As it stands, the lex-parser is generated by the usage of LARK, a library for Python. The documentation for LARK is found [here](lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en.stable/). The context-sensitive grammar is currently handling basic arithmetic, as well as the declaration of variables to generate a parse-tree. More discretely, the totality of the foundational derivations in the grammar are working as-intended, too. However, syntactic error recovery and exception-handling is yet to be implemented.

## Semantic Analyzer

Once LARK generates its parse-tree from the input, the grammar-ast file will simultaeounsly use the pattern-matching to invoke grammar-ast-alt to construct the Abstract syntax tree. This is not yet tested to be working for whatever is working in the previous stage. It is tested that `while` is working, but more critically remains untested for things like `bool` in Quack, a dependency of the former. So, this part is only in its beginning stages of testing.

## Intermediate Code Generator and Onwards

Intermediate code generation is still in progress. Since this is a dependency for the subsequent stages, this is as far as has been implemented.
